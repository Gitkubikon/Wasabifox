If you'd like to support the continued development of the extension, please consider contributing with Patreon, PayPal or Bitcoin.\n\nThe extension helps journalists and researchers verify the authenticity of images, and assists in the identification of false information on social media. Search by Image is also popular among photographers, helping artists explore how their work is shared on the web, while shoppers find it valuable for discovering similar products at discounted prices.\n\nThe extension enables you to search for images from the context menu and the browser toolbar with the help of a diverse set of reverse image search engines, which can be toggled and reordered from the extension's options. Visit the wiki for the full list of supported search engines.\n\nhttps://github.com/dessant/search-by-image/wiki/Search-engines\n\nImages positioned at the selected area are detected regardless of how they were embedded in the page.

The search mode can be set independently for the context menu and the browser toolbar from the extension's options.\n\nSearch modes:\n\n    Select URL: select an image on the page and search with the image URL. This is the default search mode.\n    Select image: select an image on the page and search with the image file. This search mode is preferred for sites which do not allow the direct linking of images, such as private sites.\n    Capture: search with a captured area of the page.\n    Browse: search with an image from your device. Pasting images from the clipboard is also supported on desktop platforms.\n    URL: search with an image URL.\n\n\nThe image you select during a search is sent to the requested service, such as Google Images.

These colors can then be used to style your terminal, window manager, etc. This add-on will take those same colors and automatically create a Firefox theme with them, using the Firefox Theme API (no CSS). This allows for dynamic theming, without the need of a restart.\n\nThe reason that you need to install a script on your computer is because Firefox has no way of getting the colors generated by Pywal natively. Generated colors are stored in a file on your computer and the script handles the communication with your browser.\n\nThe colors used for the theme can be customized, either by selecting a color from your Pywal colors or by choosing a custom color using the colorpicker.\n\nIf you are using DuckDuckGo, the add-on has an option to automatically change the colors of DuckDuckGo to match your browser theme.\n\nThere is also an included CSS file that can be enabled. The CSS will style dropdown- and context menus, add bold text and more.\n\nYou can submit issues/bugs here: https://github.com/frewacom/pywalfox/issues","weeklyDownloads":52,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"Fredrik Engstrand","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/13322493/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/274/274151.png?modified=1665999155","width":1113,"height":885,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/274/274151.jpg?modified=1665999155","thumbnailWidth":503,"thumbnailHeight":400},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/274/274152.png?modified=1665999154","width":1113,"height":885,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/274/274152.jpg?modified=1665999154","thumbnailWidth":503,"thumbnailHeight":400},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/274/274153.png?modified=1665999154","width":1113,"height":885,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/274/274153.jpg?modified=1665999154","thumbnailWidth":503,"thumbnailHeight":400},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/274/274154.png?modified=1665999155","width":1113,"height":885,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/274/274154.jpg?modified=1665999155","thumbnailWidth":503,"thumbnailHeight":400},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/274/274155.png?modified=1665999154","width":1113,"height":885,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/274/274155.jpg?modified=1665999154","thumbnailWidth":503,"thumbnailHeight":400},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/274/274156.png?modified=1665999154","width":1113,"height":885,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/274/274156.jpg?modified=1665999154","thumbnailWidth":503,"thumbnailHeight":400},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/274/274157.png?modified=1665999154","width":1113,"height":885,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/274/274157.jpg?modified=1665999154","thumbnailWidth":503,"thumbnailHeight":400},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/274/274158.png?modified=1665999154","width":1113,"height":885,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/274/274158.jpg?modified=1665999154","thumbnailWidth":503,"thumbnailHeight":400},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/274/274159.png?modified=1665999154","width":1113,"height":885,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/274/274159.jpg?modified=1665999154","thumbnailWidth":503,"thumbnailHeight":400},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/274/274160.png?modified=1665999154","width":1113,"height":885,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/274/274160.jpg?modified=1665999154","thumbnailWidth":503,"thumbnailHeight":400}],"contributionURL":"","averageRating":4.7273,"reviewCount":4,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/pywalfox/reviews/","updateDate":1674567917000},{"id":"{85f7a5ec-931d-4876-80fb-1eec3d48fc92}","icons":{"32":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/886/886768-32.png?modified=1511940481","64":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/886/886768-64.png?modified=1511940481","128":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/886/886768-128.png?modified=1511940481"},"name":"Cite-It","version":"1.1","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/784359/cite_it-1.1.xpi","homepageURL":null,"supportURL":null,"description":"This add-on creates bibtex citation for you from your selected paper name.\n\nSelect any research paper name from any online/offline paper, pdf or just webpage.
