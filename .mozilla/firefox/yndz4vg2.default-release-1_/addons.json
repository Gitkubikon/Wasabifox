If it's unnecessary, you can remove it from the toolbar.\n\n\nPermissions:\n\nThis extension needs following permissions to work as expected:\n\n    Required:\n        Access browser tabs: to list both active and non-active tabs in the UI.\n        Access recently closed tabs (access to the session information): to save tree information of tabs (structure, collapsed/expanded state, etc.) to tabs' session information and ask to Firefox to manage them as bundled.\n        Display notifications to you: to present information and navigate users without blocking.\n    Optional:\n        Read and modify bookmarks: to simulate bookmark related commands in the tab context menu. / to detect tabs whether they were opened from bookmarks or not.\n        Access your data for all websites (run scripts on webpages): to detect the Ctrl key is pressed/released and prevent needless expansion of collapsed trees while tab switching with Ctrl-Tab/Ctrl-Shift-Tab.\n        Hide and show browser tabs: just for automated tests, not required on regular use.\n\n\nExtensions extend TST:\n\nTST provides an API for other extensions.\nSome extend the behavior of TST's sidebar panel:\n\n    Multiple Tab Handler allows you to select multiple tabs with long-press on tabs.
